    The NetBeans Platform module system is responsible for quickly loading the hundreths of modules that comprise the NetBeans IDE very quickly.
    By using declarative information, it avoids running unnecessary code at startup, making all NetBeans Platform based applications launch blasting fast.
    As a plus, the NetBeans Module System is able to handle OSGi modules too.

    Most serious applications need more than one window. Coding good interaction between multiple windows is not a trivial task. 
    The NetBeans window system lets you maximize/minimize, dock/undock, and drag-and-drop windows, without you providing any code at all.
