# Apache NetBeans Incubator Demo App

This is a simple desktop application built on top of the Apache NetBeans
Incubator Platform.

The application shows a list of installed modules, as well as some information
about each module. It also highlights some of the features of the NetBeans
Platform.

## Building

- Build the [Apache NetBeans Incubator Platform](https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans).
- Use the NetBeans IDE to open and run the project in the [netbeans-platform-demo](/netbeans-platform-demo) directory.

## Pre-built binaries

There are not pre-built binaries for any platform. You can build these yourself, though.
